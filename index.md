This project is related to mine because *the difference with the fourth project is that this is simpler and the materials are more daily. But the device in front of it is more complicated and provides me with a good reference.*.

## Other research ##
*Include here any other relevant research you have done. This might include identifying readings, tutorials, videos, technical documents, or other resources that have been helpful. For each particular source, add a comment or two about why it is relevant or what you have taken from it.*

### *CleanSweep: The Floor Cleaning Robot* ###

In this project, the rotating mop at the front of the robot and the foam roller at the rear can complete the work well. There is also a water pump and water reservoir that can be opened when needed to sprinkle water on the floor and moisten the mop for proper cleaning. The foam roller is movable, which means that you can lift the foam roller when not in use. In addition, speed control is added to the drive motor in this robot. This project is still a bit complicated for me, but I am more clear about how my robot should be done.*

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
*A floor cleaning robot with Mecanum Wheels*

### Design concept 1 ###
*Design concept 1:A board with a rag is installed in front of the robot. When the robot is moved by remote control, the rag will start to work and wipe the floor.* 



### Design concept 2 ###
*Design concept 2: When the robot is equipped with Mecanum Wheels, it can rotate 360, not just forward or backward.*

### Final design concept ###
*can install a dry rag or a foam shaft that can be rolled behind the robot to wipe off the water stains on the ground.*

### Interaction flowchart ###
*Draw a draft flowchart of what you anticipate the interaction process in your project to be. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

*In this section, show your progress including whichever of the following are appropriate for your project at this point.
a.	Technical development. Could be code screenshots, pictures of electronics and hardware testing, video of tests. 
b.	Fabrication. Physical models, rough prototypes, sketches, diagrams of form, material considerations, mood boards, etc.
Ensure you include comments about the choices you've made along the way.*

*You will probably have a range of images and screenshots. Any test videos should be uploaded to YouTube or other publicly accessible site and a link provided here.*
