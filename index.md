This project is related to mine because *as a housewife, I hope my robot can help me do more. This simple mopping robot provides me with a good direction.*.

### Related project 5 ###
*Vacuuming Robot*

*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4Qe1n-1uWg*

This project is related to mine because *this homemade vacuum cleaner is very interesting. This gives my project more inspiration, and I can consider setting more functions for the robot.*.

### Related project 6 ###
*Floor Cleaning Machine*

*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mMsg4ikuIA*

![Image](relatedproject06.PNG)

This project is related to mine because *the difference with the fourth project is that this is simpler and the materials are more daily. But the device in front of it is more complicated and provides me with a good reference.*.

## Other research ##
*Include here any other relevant research you have done. This might include identifying readings, tutorials, videos, technical documents, or other resources that have been helpful. For each particular source, add a comment or two about why it is relevant or what you have taken from it.*

### *Brief resource name/description* ###

*Provide a link, reference, or whatever is required for somebody else to find the resource. Then provide a few comments about what you have drawn from the resource.*

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
*A floor cleaning robot with Mecanum Wheels*

### Design concept 1 ###
*A board with a rag is installed in front of the robot. When the robot is moved by remote control, the rag will start to work and wipe the floor.* 

*Put the first two design concepts in the sections "Design concept 1" and "Design concept 2". Then put the third, with more development in the section "Final design concept".*

### Design concept 2 ###
*esign concept 2: A paint-on keyboard/temporary tattoo for your arm that you lick to play notes. [The
tattoo could be made of some kind of conductive fluid that hardens, or maybe even a coloured sugar syrup
painted in stripes and the lick essentially bridges two stripes, effectively making them a button.]*

### Final design concept ###
*Design concept 3: A set of small water fountains that you have to drink from to activate sequences of notes.
[Although it looks like you have to actually drink from the water, a set of light sensors or ultrasonic sensors
detects where your head is and activates tones when it seems your head must be in a position to drink.]*

### Interaction flowchart ###
*Draw a draft flowchart of what you anticipate the interaction process in your project to be. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

*In this section, show your progress including whichever of the following are appropriate for your project at this point.
a.	Technical development. Could be code screenshots, pictures of electronics and hardware testing, video of tests. 
b.	Fabrication. Physical models, rough prototypes, sketches, diagrams of form, material considerations, mood boards, etc.
Ensure you include comments about the choices you've made along the way.*

*You will probably have a range of images and screenshots. Any test videos should be uploaded to YouTube or other publicly accessible site and a link provided here.*

## Design process discussion ##
*Discuss your process in getting to this point, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process.*

## Next steps ##
*Write a list or provide other information about your plan to move the project forward to be ready to present by video and documentation in week 12 of the course.*
